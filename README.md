This project provides a library of different barrier and phaser algorithms to
facilitate synchronization of concurrent programs.

The algorithms are typical textbook implementations or current research
results. They are targeted for multi- and many-core CPUs.

The phaser implementations are meant to facilitate fine-grained fork/join
parallelism and provide advanced control to avoid over-synchronization.

This repository includes the code for the following paper:

  Fine-grained Parallelism, Stefan Marr, Stijn Verhaegen, Bruno De Fraine, Theo
  Dâ€™Hondt, Wolfgang De Meuter, Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International
