This project provides a library of different barrier and phaser algorithms to facilitate synchronization of concurrent programs.

The algorithms are typical textbook implementations or current research results.
They are targeted for multi- and many-core CPUs.

The phaser implementations are meant to facilitate fine-grained fork/join parallelism and provide advanced control to avoid over-synchronization.
